        expected)
        3 state that transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA
        and are involved in the control of gene expression in eukaryotes
        by decreasing or increasing the rate of transcription

        disruptive and directional forces of natural selection

19 Genetic technology

    19.1 Principles of genetic technology
        1 define the term recombinant DNA
        2 explain that genetic engineering is the deliberate manipulation
